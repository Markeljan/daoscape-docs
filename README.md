# ⚔ DAOScape

DAOScape is a community driven P2E / Play to BUILD web3 game coming to the Harmony blockchain Q3 2022.

DAO members have authority over the direction of gameplay through high frequency updates based on feature polls. DAOScape mutates rapidly, taking shape more and more each week into the dream game desired by its community.

Feature polls are weekly/biweekly and developer(s) work diligently to push them forward. No empty promise roadmap. Development is open source and fully transparent from day 0.

As the game evolves, branch worlds can be forked or archived.

DAOScape will follow a ship first model. We will be feature-rich on launch and implement new features hyper frequently! Lets BUILD OUR game. ⚔️ DAOScape
